2. A brief description of the program.
Program that shows 10 available cities, tells user to input a city via their number, and displays a table showing its
population and hypothetical 2% growth rate for 20 years

3. Any variables you are creating.
conn
c
cities
city
population
year
growth_rate
initial_population
years
populations
data
selected_city
choice

4. Any functions you are creating.
create_database()
insert_initial_data()
simulate_population_growth()
visualize_population_growth(city)
main()

5. The logical steps to your program. Numbers your steps or write as pseudocode so it's easy for me to follow.
Import sqlite3
Import matplotlib.pyplot

connect to 'population_TJ.db'
create a cursor
run SQL to create table 'population' if not exists
commit
close the connection

cities = list of cities with populations
connect to 'population_TJ.db'
create a cursor
for each city and population in cities do
    insert city, year 2023, and population into 'population' table
commit
close the connection

connect to 'population_TJ.db'
create a cursor
growth_rate = 0.02
run SQL to get distinct cities
for each city do
    get population for city in year 2023
    set initial_population
    set population to initial_population
    for years from 2024 to 2043 do
        calculate new population with growth_rate
        insert city, year, and population into 'population' table
commit
close the connection

define city
connect to 'population_TJ.db'
create a cursor
run SQL to get year and population for city
get all data
extract years and populations
create a plot with years on x-axis, populations on y-axis
set plot title to 'Population Growth for city'
show the plot

call create_database
call insert_initial_data
call simulate_population_growth

cities = list of available cities
print list of cities and numbers
read user input for city choice
if choice is valid do
    set selected_city to the city from user choice
    call visualize_population_growth with selected_city
else
    print 'Invalid choice. Run the program again.'

if script is run directly
    call main
