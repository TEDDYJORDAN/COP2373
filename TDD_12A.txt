2. A brief description of the program.
Program that reads the grades.csv file and calculates the mean, medium, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, overall
statistics and overall passing grades

3. Any variables you are creating.
data
means
medians
std_devs
mins
maxs
num_exams
i
all_grades
overall_mean
overall_median
overall_std_dev
overall_min
overall_max
passing_grade
num_passed
num_failed
num_passed_overall
num_total_grades
pass_percentage

4. Any functions you are creating.
numpy.genfromtxt
numpy.mean
numpy.median
numpy.std
numpy.min
numpy.max
numpy.sum
numpy.flatten

5. The logical steps to your program. Numbers your steps or write as pseudocode so it's easy for me to follow.
Import Numpy

Load data from 'grades.csv', with delimiter and skip_header
    Print Dataset
    Print 10 rows of data
    Print blank line

Print "Statistics for each exam"
means = compute mean of each column in data
medians = compute median of each column in data
std_devs = compute standard deviation of each column in data
mins = compute minimum of each column in data
maxs = compute maximum of each column in data

num_exams = number of columns in data

    For each exam index i from 0 to num_exams - 1 do
        Print "Exam i+1:"
        print mean[i]
        print median[i]
        print standard deviation[i]
        Print minimum[i]
        print maximum[i]
        Print blank line


   # Calculate and print statistics for all exams
    Print "Overall statistics for all exams:"
    all_grades = Flatten data into a single array

    overall_mean = compute mean of all_grades
    overall_median = compute median of all_grades
    overall_std_dev = compute standard deviation of all_grades
    overall_min = compute minimum of all_grades
    overall_max = compute maximum of all_grades

    Print overall_mean

    # Print the number of students who passed and failed each exam
    passing_grade = 60
    Print "Pass/fail counts for each exam:"
    For each exam index i from 0 to num_exams - 1 do
        num_passed = count number of grades in data[:, i] >= passing_grade
        num_failed = total number of students - num_passed
        Print "Exam i+1:"
        Print num_passed
        Print num_failed
        Print blank line


    # Print the overall pass percentage across all exams
    num_passed_overall = count number of grades in all_grades >= passing_grade
    num_total_grades = size of all_grades

    pass_percentage = (num_passed_overall / num_total_grades) * 100

    Print pass_percentage
