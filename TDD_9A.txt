5. The logical steps to your program. Numbers your steps or write as pseudocode so it's easy for me to follow.
class BankAcct
    method __init__(self, name, account_number, amount, interest_rate):
        self.name to name
        self.account_number to account_number
        self.amount to amount
        self.interest_rate to interest_rate

    adjust_interest_rate(self, new_rate):
        self.interest_rate to new_rate

    withdraw(self, amount):
        If amount > self.amount:
            Print "Insufficient funds"
        Else:
            Subtract amount from self.amount

    deposit(self, amount):
        Add amount to self.amount

    get_balance(self):
        Return self.amount

    calculate_interest(self, days):
        Return self.amount * (self.interest_rate / 100) * (days / 365)

    __str__(self):
        Return formatted string with account details

function test_bank_acct():
    create instance acct of BankAcct with "Teddy Jordan", "987654321", 10000.00, 4.0

    print acct

    call acct.deposit(500.00)
    print "\nAfter depositing $500.00:"
    print acct

    call acct.withdraw(200.00)
    print "\nAfter withdrawing $200.00:"
    print acct

    set interest to acct.calculate_interest(30)
    print "\nInterest for 30 days: $" and interest

    call acct.adjust_interest_rate(4.0)
    print "\nAfter adjusting interest rate to 4.0%:"
    print acct

    set balance to acct.get_balance()
    print "\nCurrent balance: $" and balance

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Call test_bank_acct()
