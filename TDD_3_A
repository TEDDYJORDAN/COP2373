2. A brief description of the program.
program that asks the user to input expenses and the amount of them, then when you input "done" it totals the total,
highest and lowest expense

3. Any variables you are creating.
expenses, expense_type, amount, total_expense, highest expense, lowest_expense

4. Any functions you are creating.
get_expenses(), analyze_expenses(expenses), main()

5. The logical steps to your program. Numbers your steps or write as pseudocode so it's easy for me to follow.
1. program starts by calling the get_expenses() function. It uses a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for the
expenses until the user enters "done" to indicate that they have finished entering all expenses.
The data is stored in a list of tuples containing the type and amount.
2. The analyze_expenses(expenses) function
takes the list and analyzes it to calculate the total expense, highest expense, and lowest expense.
It uses the reduce() function from the functools to perform the calculations.
If the list of expenses is empty, it returns None.
3. The main() function calls the get_expenses() function to collect
expenses from the user and then calls the analyze_expenses() function to analyze these expenses then print it.
