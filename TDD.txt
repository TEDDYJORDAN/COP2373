5. The logical steps to your program. Numbers your steps or write as pseudocode so it's easy for me to follow.
Define a function sell_tickets().
start the first value in the input set to total_tickets_sold and total_buyers.
Use a while loop to sell tickets until the total is 20
in the loop prompt the user to enter the number of tickets they want to buy.
Use an if statement to check if the number is between 1-4 and if enough are available.
If valid, update and display the remaining tickets. if not display again.
after all tickets are sold, display the total number of buyers.
